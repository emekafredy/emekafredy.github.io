            	<h2>Variety of Choices!</h2>
            	<P>
            		Information and communication technology is a vast field encompassing virtually all technologies that can store, receive or transmit signals electronically. With electronic devices so tightly wound into the fabric of modern society, the advantages and disadvantages of ICT use may not be immediately apparent. ICT has opened up a wide range of new communication methods, allowing you to contact others for less money and over greater distances than ever before. Technologies such as texting, instant messaging and video conferencing allow users to communicate instantaneously with people across the world for a nominal fee, a concept which may have seemed ludicrous before the advent of computers. In addition, text-based computer communication can give those with speech or social problems a level playing field to communicate with their peers.

            		Since communication technology speeds the transfer of information, employees in an organization can easily consult each other and analyze information in a shortest period and make a decision.   Also with the use of (OLAP) Online analytical processing, employees can perform queries on a database to get data about a specific client  or matter and make a quick decision basing on the data retrieved from the database about that specific client or matter. Communication technology helps in the creation of a shared information environment in an organization.  Organization information is organized in one central location, allowing any one access that information as they need. Also technologies like electronic mail, will enable low level employees communicate with the manager without any need of having a dedicated time for meeting. This allows information to flow easily from the bottom to the top without any barriers.Lets look at an organization were you only see the operations manager twice a week, by the time he comes, every one will need to speak to them and they will have less time for each of you. But with electronic mail, you can simply draft an email and send it to your superior or workmate. In this case, they don’t have to stop what they’re doing to attend to your matter, but you will get an instant reply and continue with your work.Communication technology puts every thing were it is supposed to be. No need to see papers and files every where in the office. All data is stored on the database, and you will have less paper work in the organization which makes life easier at work. Also the organization will spend more time on other productive section since the time to organize their data is saved by technology.

            		The number one benefit of information technology is that it empowers people to do what they want to do. It lets people be creative. It lets people be productive. It lets people learn things they didn't think they could learn before, and so in a sense it is all about potential
					You look at marketing: everything that's happening in marketing is digitized. Everything that's happening in finance is digitized. So pretty much every industry, every function in every industry, has a huge element that's driven by information technology. It's no longer discrete.
